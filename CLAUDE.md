# CLAUDE.md

Personal academic website for Varun Gandhi (MS CS @ UMass Amherst, AI research / LLM post-training).
Static Astro site. Design goal: **minimal and easy to maintain** — resist adding dependencies,
frameworks, or client-side JS beyond what exists.

## Commands

```sh
npm run dev      # dev server at http://localhost:4321 (hot reload)
npm run build    # static build into dist/ — ALWAYS run to verify changes
npm run preview  # serve dist/
```

No tests. Verification = clean build + grep the built HTML in `dist/` for expected output.
After making changes, if `npm run dev` isn't already running, start it in the background by
default so the user can manually look at the result in a browser.

**Deploy**: live at https://vgandhi13.github.io — pushing to `main` on
github.com/vgandhi13/vgandhi13.github.io triggers `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
(withastro/action → GitHub Pages).

## Layout of the repo

- `src/pages/index.astro` — the entire homepage: hero (profile pic, bio, social icon links),
  jump-nav (News · Research · Teaching), Karpathy-style experience **timeline**, scrollable
  **News** box, Research (papers), Teaching. All homepage edits happen here.
- `src/layouts/Base.astro` — header/footer, theme toggle, **all global CSS + color variables**.
- `src/layouts/Entry.astro` — wrapper for a single note/blog post (imports KaTeX CSS).
- `src/content/notes/*.md`, `src/content/blog/*.md` — content collections (schema in
  `src/content.config.ts`: `title`, `description?`, `date`, `updated?`, `draft`). Filename =
  URL slug. `date` = created (immutable); bump `updated` to today whenever revising content —
  the entry page shows "· Updated <date>" when it differs from `date`.
- `src/components/Search.astro` + `src/pages/search-index.json.ts` + `src/lib/stopwords.js` —
  client-side full-text search (see below).
- `public/profile.jpg`, `public/logos/*.png`, `public/images/notes/*` — static assets.
- `Notes/` and `Context/` — **the user's raw source material, NOT built into the site.**
  One folder per topic: `Notes/<Topic>/main.md` with source images alongside it (e.g.
  `Notes/InstructionFinetuning/main.md` + `lr1image.png`). These rough drafts get converted
  into `src/content/notes/` (see the publish-content skill). `Context/*.txt` holds bio/CV
  facts used to fill homepage sections.

## Conventions & gotchas

- **After adding any new feature or convention**, check whether it should be recorded for
  future sessions: update an existing skill (`.claude/skills/`), create a new one if it's a
  repeatable workflow, or add a line here — so the next agent can pick up where this one left
  off. Prefer one home per fact (skill for authoring workflows, CLAUDE.md for site-wide
  facts/gotchas) to avoid drift.

- **Never use em dashes (—)** in notes, blog posts, or any prose on this site. Use a comma,
  colon, semicolon, or parentheses instead, whichever fits the sentence. En dashes (–) in
  numeric ranges (e.g. `5–8 × 10^-5`) or compound modifiers are fine and not affected by this rule.
- **Stale Vite dep cache**: if client-side JS (e.g. search) silently stops working in dev and
  the console shows `504 Outdated Optimize Dep`, kill the dev server, `rm -rf
  node_modules/.vite`, and restart. Happens when deps change while the server runs.
- **Astro scoped styles don't reach JS-created DOM.** Any element built with
  `document.createElement` needs its styles in a `<style is:global>` block (this bit us in
  Search.astro). Keep such selectors namespaced (`.search-*`).
- **Theme**: light/dark via `data-theme` on `<html>`, set pre-paint by an inline script in
  Base.astro, persisted in localStorage, falls back to `prefers-color-scheme`. All colors are
  CSS variables in Base.astro (`--bg, --text, --heading, --text-muted, --link, --border,
  --surface, --mark-bg, --venue, --venue-workshop`). Dark palette was contrast-tuned (WCAG AA,
  body ~10:1, muted ~5:1); keep headings brighter than body text.
- **Accepted papers** in the Research section wrap their venue in a span so it renders semibold
  in an accent color, while a still-unaccepted `arXiv preprint, YYYY` stays muted — the two read
  as different states in the list. Two tiers, two hues: `.venue-accepted` → `--venue` amber
  (`#8a6412` light 5.37:1 / `#d9a93a` dark 7.88:1) for archival venues (main conference,
  Findings); `.venue-workshop` → `--venue-workshop` green (`#146c3f` light 6.47:1 / `#5fd39a`
  dark 9.17:1) for workshops. Reuse the tokens for the next acceptance rather than hardcoding a
  hex. **The venue string must name the tier itself** (say "Workshop" when it is one) — the
  color is decoration, the words are the claim, and abbreviating a workshop paper to just
  "RLC 2026" would read as a main-conference paper. User picked amber from a rendered comparison
  of green/blue/amber/teal and pill variants (pill rejected as too much furniture), then chose
  green for workshops; they were told green-as-success next to amber-as-caution can imply the
  workshop is the stronger result, and accepted that tradeoff.
- **Excerpts share links** (`src/pages/quotes.astro`): every excerpt renders as `<li id={slug}>`
  with a "Copy link" control that copies an absolute `…/quotes/#slug`. Slugs come from the
  author (`slugify`). Slugs are deliberately **not** position-derived: a second quote by the same
  author throws at build time rather than silently taking `#author` and pushing the existing one
  to `-2`, which would repoint links already shared. Resolve a clash by adding an explicit `id`
  to the *newer* quote and leaving the older slug alone. Two things that look redundant are not: the control is a real `<a href="#slug">` so it
  still works without JS or clipboard access (the address bar becomes the shareable thing), and
  the script re-runs `scrollIntoView` on `DOMContentLoaded` because the pre-paint shuffle moves
  the element the browser already jumped to, landing a shared link at the wrong offset.

- **Excerpt figures** (`image: { src, alt }` on a quote): attaches a diagram from the same
  source under the quote, stored in `public/images/quotes/`. A trimmed screenshot is still a
  rectangle of paper, and on the excerpt card that rectangle reads as a slab, so the flat
  background is blended away rather than shown: `mix-blend-mode: multiply` drops white onto
  `--surface`, and dark mode does `filter: invert(1)` + `screen` to drop the black. Both are
  lossless **only for grayscale line art** — convert with Pillow's `.convert('L')` when adding
  one; a colored diagram would come out hue-flipped and needs the plain white-figure treatment
  instead. (This is the same white-slab problem as the `train_async` SVG, solved for the case
  where the art has no color to lose.)

- **Search**: `/search-index.json` is generated at build from both collections. Each doc has
  `text` (stop-word-stripped, for Fuse.js fuzzy matching), `plain` (readable, for sentence
  previews), and `description` (frontmatter, shown when only the title matches). Stop words
  live in `src/lib/stopwords.js`, shared by index and query side. Result cards: query words
  are highlighted in the title whenever they match; preview priority is body sentence
  (deep-linked via `#:~:text=`) → description → first 140 chars. `<Search scope="note|blog">`
  sets the placeholder and ranks that collection first (other collection still shown, badged).
  Stay dependency-light: Fuse.js only.
- **Search ranking is scope → literal overlap → Fuse score**, in that order (`Array.sort` is
  stable, so Fuse's own order, including its 2× title weight, breaks ties). "Literal overlap"
  = for each query token, the length of its longest prefix literally present in title+`plain`,
  **summed across tokens** so multi-token queries rank on total coverage. Summing matters: on
  "proximal policy optimization" both RL notes tie at 12 on the longest single token
  ("optimization"), and only the sum (26 vs 25) separates a full `proximal` from `proxima`
  found inside "ap**proxima**tion".
  This exists because Fuse ranks by *edit distance*, so an unrelated near-miss can beat a real
  hit by a rounding error: on "clipped", `flipped` in policy-gradients (1 substitution, score
  .9600) outranked `grad clip` in instruction-finetuning (.9631) — a 0.3% gap deciding the
  whole order. Don't "fix" that class of bug by lowering Fuse's `threshold`; it would take
  inflection recall with it. Add ranking evidence instead.
- **Search prefix matching** (`prefixMatch`, drives highlighting, previews, deep links, and
  the overlap key): a query token matches its own longest prefix present in the text, but at
  least **half the token, min 3 chars**. Half is load-bearing — `clip` is 4/7 of "clipped" and
  must keep matching, while `cli` (3/7, from "**cli**mb") must not, so a flat 60% floor is
  wrong. Known wart: 2–4 char queries keep the 3-char floor, so "kl" still marks *quic**kl**y*
  and "clip" still marks *cli* in *climb*; both rank last now, but a word-boundary bonus is
  the real fix if it ever matters.
- **Search recall fallback** retries with end-trimmed tokens while *no hit has any literal
  overlap* — deliberately **not** gated on zero hits. A fully-typed inflection scores worse in
  Fuse than its own prefix ("sweeping" .9713 vs "sweepin" .9631), so "sweeping" returned two
  notes that don't contain "sweep" and missed the only one that does; the junk hits were
  exactly what suppressed the retry. A retry never replaces hits with none.
- **Search `<mark>` styling must be `.search-hit mark`**, not `.search-snippet mark` — both the
  title and the snippet get marks, and scoping it to the snippet left title marks on the
  browser default (black-on-yellow), which only shows up when a query matches a *title*.
  Unresolved: dark-mode marks are below the AA the rest of the palette holds to, because
  `color: inherit` puts low-contrast text on `--mark-bg` `#5c4d12` (snippet/muted 2.51:1,
  title/link 3.97:1). `color: var(--heading)` would take both to 7.28:1; user hasn't decided.
- **Verifying client-side JS** (search etc.): grepping `dist/` isn't enough — drive it with
  playwright headless against the dev server, `chromium.launch({ channel: 'chrome' })` to use
  installed Chrome (no browser download). Playwright is NOT installed globally or in the repo:
  `npm init -y && npm i playwright` in the session scratchpad first. Test scripts go in the
  scratchpad, not the repo. Capture console errors; that's how the 504 bug below was found.
  (Screenshot artifact: a dark pill-shaped Chrome-extension overlay can appear mid-page in
  headless screenshots — it's not part of the site.)
- **Math**: remark-math + rehype-katex are configured; `$...$` / `$$...$$` in any markdown.
  GFM footnotes (`[^name]`) work. Footnote sections are styled globally in Base.astro
  (`.footnotes`: divider + smaller muted text) and the auto-generated "Footnotes" h2 is
  **intentionally hidden** via `.sr-only` — its absence on the page is not a bug.
- **Images**: compress before adding — `sips -Z 640 -s format jpeg -s formatOptions 80 in.jpg
  --out public/...` for photos; note figures go in `public/images/notes/`. To size an image
  down in markdown, use an inline `<img width="450">` tag instead of `![]()`. Diagrams saved
  from slides/web often carry huge white margins that push figcaptions away — trim them (no
  ImageMagick on this machine; use a Pillow venv in the scratchpad, `ImageChops.difference`
  vs white + `getbbox`). Cited figures use `<figure>`/`<figcaption>` (global styles in
  Base.astro); details in the publish-content skill.
- **Wide diagrams**: `<figure class="wide">` breaks out of the 58rem prose column up to 1280px
  and scrolls below ~1024px instead of shrinking (global styles in Base.astro). Shrink-to-fit is
  right for a photo and wrong for a dense diagram: at column width the `train_async` SVG's 11px
  labels became ~7px. Verified no page-level horizontal scroll at 1440/1024/390 — the `100vw`
  breakout leaves 2.5rem of slack so the scrollbar can't push the body sideways.
  Known: an SVG carrying its own light background rect renders as a bright slab in dark mode
  (`/images/blog/train_async_diagram.svg` does). That one is *written* against `currentColor`
  (26 uses), so inlining it into the page instead of `<img>`-ing it would make it theme-aware,
  but its two accents (`#4A90CF`, `#D98A24`) would then need retuning per theme — `#4A90CF` is
  only ~3.3:1 on white. User hasn't decided; the white-slab version is consistent with the
  white-background figures already in the notes.

- **Logos** for timeline entries: `curl -sL -o public/logos/<domain>.png
  "https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=<domain>&sz=128"`.
- The homepage header hides the site name (`hideSiteName` prop on Base) because the hero shows
  it; subpages show it top-left.
- **Intentional easter eggs — do not remove**: the HTML comment in Base.astro, the console.log
  in the theme script, and `public/humans.txt` (credits: Claude Code, Karpathy/Weng design
  inspiration).

## Current state / open TODOs

- **LeetCode URL is a placeholder** in `src/pages/index.astro` (`YOUR_LEETCODE`) —
  ask the user for the real username. (GitHub is set: vgandhi13.)
- **Analytics undecided**: user wants per-page views + referrers; GoatCounter was
  recommended (free, no-cookie, one script tag in Base.astro). Wire it in when they decide.
- Blog is intentionally empty (`draft: true` template at `src/content/blog/example-post.md`).
- Motional logo is low-res (48px favicon upscale) — replace `public/logos/motional.com.png`
  if the user provides a better one.
- Content tension the user hasn't resolved: the packing footnote in the instruction-finetuning
  note says packing isn't used in SFT, but the OLMo 3 paragraph says its SFT infra uses
  sequence packing.
- **No favicon** — every page 404s on `/favicon.ico` (visible in console). User was offered
  one (e.g. "V" monogram SVG) but hasn't decided.
- The CS231n learning-rate figure in the instruction-finetuning note credits its source only
  in alt text; the newer convention is a visible `<figcaption>` (see policy-gradients note).
  User was offered the retrofit but hasn't decided.
