I am interested in AI, particularly interpretability, alignment, and systems. My current work focuses on test-time reinforcement learning with uncertainty for large language models and interpreting physical reasoning in deep reinforcement learning agents.

This past summer, I interned as a Machine Learning Engineer with the Vision-Language Models team at Sarvam AI, where I contributed to their efforts in building India's sovereign language model. The previous summer, I interned as a Data Engineer at DXFactor, developing a data warehouse and ETL pipelines.
