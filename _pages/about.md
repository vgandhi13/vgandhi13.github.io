I am interested in AI and its interpretability, alignment and Systems. To this extent, I am currentLy working on Test time Reinforcement Learning with Uncertainty for Large Language Models, and Interpreting Physical Reasoning in Deep Reinforcement Learning Agents.

This summer I interned in the Vision Language Models team at Sarvam AI as a Machine Learning Engineer and contributed to their efforts of sovereign language model. Last summer, I interned at DXFactor as a Data Engineer where I worked on creating a data warehous and ETL pipelines.
